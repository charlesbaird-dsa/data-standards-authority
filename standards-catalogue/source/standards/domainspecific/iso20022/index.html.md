# Universal financial industry message scheme

ISO 20022 is a multi part International Standard prepared by ISO Technical Committee TC68 Financial Services. It describes a common platform for the development of messages using:
 - a modelling methodology to capture in a syntax-independent way financial business areas, business transactions and associated message flows
 - a central dictionary of business items used in financial communications
 - a set of XML and ASN.1 design rules to convert the message models into XML or ASN.1 schemas, whenever the use of the ISO 20022 XML or ASN.1-based syntax is preferred.
